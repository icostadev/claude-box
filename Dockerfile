# --- Vite+ (VoidZero unified toolchain) manages the Node.js runtime ----------
# Docker RUN steps don't source shell profiles, so put VP_HOME/bin (where the
# `vp` binary + node/corepack/pnpm shims live) on PATH explicitly.
ENV VP_HOME=/root/.vite-plus
ENV PATH=$VP_HOME/bin:$PATH
RUN curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash

# Vite+ manages Node by default and auto-installs the latest LTS on first use of
# its shims (node/corepack), so no explicit `vp env install` step is needed.

# --- pnpm via corepack, then Claude Code -------------------------------------
# pnpm global installs land in PNPM_HOME; put it on PATH so `claude` resolves.
ENV PNPM_HOME=/root/.local/share/pnpm
ENV PATH=$PNPM_HOME/bin:$PATH
# pnpm v11 blocks dependency build scripts by default; --allow-build lets
# claude-code run its postinstall (which downloads the platform-native binary).
RUN corepack enable \
 && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate \
 && pnpm add -g --allow-build=@anthropic-ai/claude-code @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# --- pnpm: persistent shared store + private-registry auth -------------------
# Two settings are baked into the USER-level ~/.npmrc (= a trusted source); a
# third, OPTIONAL piece — which @scopes are private — is deployment-specific and
# is supplied out-of-band, so NO org/scope name is hardcoded in the image:
#
#  store-dir  — the container is ephemeral (--rm), so a store on the container fs
#    is wiped and re-downloaded every run. Point pnpm at a dir INSIDE the bind-
#    mounted workspace: same (virtiofs) filesystem as node_modules (so pnpm can
#    hardlink instead of copy), survives container exit, and is a real host dir.
#
#  _authToken — pnpm REFUSES to expand ${ENV} in credentials read from a project
#    .npmrc (it's committed, so expanding could leak the token to a hostile
#    registry). It DOES expand them in a user-level ~/.npmrc. So the auth line
#    must live here, not in the repo. The literal ${GITHUB_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN}
#    is written verbatim (single quotes) and resolved AT RUNTIME from the env var
#    the runner forwards — no secret is baked into the image. This authenticates
#    ANY scope's packages on GitHub Packages, so it is registry- not org-specific.
#
#  scope→registry mappings — put lines like
#    `@your-scope:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/` in `registries.npmrc`
#    (gitignored; copy `registries.npmrc.example` to start). The glob COPY never
#    fails on a fresh clone because the committed .example always matches; only
#    the real file, if present, is appended to ~/.npmrc.
COPY registries.npmrc* /tmp/npmrc.d/
RUN printf '%s\n' \
      'store-dir=/root/workspace/.pnpm-store' \
      '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN}' \

# Keep ALL Claude config + credentials under one dir so a single bind-mount
# persists the login across container restarts (decoupled from the host).
ENV CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.claude

# --- Baked-in Claude Code settings (starts every session in AUTO mode) --------
# `settings.json` in this repo is the single source of truth for how Claude Code
# behaves in the box; it is copied in at BUILD time, so edits need a rebuild.
#
# It lands on the POLICY path, not $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, for two reasons:
#   * /root/.claude is bind-mounted from the host, so a settings file baked in
#     there would be shadowed at run time — the image cannot seed it.
#   * Claude Code accepts `defaultMode: "auto"` ONLY from policy, user, or
#     --settings sources; project/local settings are ignored as repo-controllable.
# The policy path lives outside every mount, so it applies to `claude` however
# it starts: the default CMD, runner args, or typed after `./claude-box shell`.
#
# Policy settings OVERRIDE the host-side user config, so keep this file to what
# the box should enforce — anything listed here can no longer be changed from
# inside a session (shift+tab still switches mode for the session at hand).
COPY settings.json /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json

# Entrypoint refreshes Claude Code to the latest release on every container
# START (the build only pins a baseline), then execs the CMD/args. It is
# best-effort: an offline start falls back to the baked-in version. Skip it with
# -e CLAUDE_BOX_SKIP_UPDATE=1. It also re-attaches bare runner flags to `claude`
# (runner args replace CMD), so `shell` and arg passthrough keep working.
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]

# The workspace bind-mount lives at ~/workspace so the host and the container
# share the same *relative* path: `~/workspace/repos/<x>` resolves identically on
# both sides, and a path copied from one works in the other.
#
# /workspace stays as a compatibility symlink — absolute `/workspace/...` paths
# are baked into things we cannot rewrite from here: git worktree `gitdir` files
# in existing clones, agent definitions and slash commands in the control-plane
# bundle, and Claude Code session history. The symlink keeps both spellings
# valid, so switching the mount is not a flag day.
